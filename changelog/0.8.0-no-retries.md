# Changelog

## [0.8.0] no retries

### Changed
- **Error Handling Strategy**: Completely removed retry mechanisms in favor of fail-fast approach
  - Removed exponential backoff and retry logic from OpenRouter client
  - Simplified API error handling to immediately move to next model on failure
  - Changed default retry count from 1 to 0 for all benchmark operations
  - Updated `run_benchmark_on_model()` and `benchmark_single_model()` to not retry on empty responses
- **Sequential Execution**: Enhanced progress tracking and error handling in sequential mode
  - Improved progress bar accuracy by adjusting total count for failed models
  - Better error reporting with clear model-by-model failure messages
  - Streamlined sequential execution flow without retry overhead

### Updated
- **Leaderboard Results**: Latest benchmark rankings with new top performer
  - New leader: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:free (1640.68 points, 36.3s)
  - Added new failed model: cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mistral-24b-venice-edition:free
  - Updated rankings reflect improved performance testing methodology

### Improved
- **Performance**: Eliminated retry delays for faster batch processing
- **Reliability**: Clear failure detection without hanging on problematic models
- **User Experience**: More predictable execution times and clearer error feedback
