### Added
- **OpenRouter API Integration**: Complete OpenRouter client implementation for live model benchmarking
  - Direct API calls to OpenRouter models with `--model` flag
  - Automatic API key management from file or environment variable
  - Built-in retry logic with exponential backoff for rate limits and server errors
  - Token usage tracking and timing metrics for all API calls
- **Batch Benchmarking**: Run benchmarks on multiple models simultaneously
  - `--run-all` flag to test all models from `models.txt`
  - `--sequential` flag for one-at-a-time execution with progress bars
  - Parallel execution with ThreadPoolExecutor for faster batch testing
  - Automatic skipping of already-tested models to avoid duplicate work
  - Real-time progress tracking with tqdm integration
- **Enhanced Leaderboard System**: Improved tracking and display of benchmark results
  - Failed runs tracking with separate display section (Score: -100)
  - Medal emojis (🥇🥈🥉) for top 3 performers
  - Separate sections for successful vs failed runs
  - Multiple runs support per model with timestamp tracking
- **Improved Error Handling**: Robust error management across all components
  - Graceful handling of empty LLM responses with configurable retries
  - Rate limit detection and automatic retry with exponential backoff
  - Clear error messages for API failures, timeouts, and invalid responses
  - Safe file operations with proper exception handling

### Changed
