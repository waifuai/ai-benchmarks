# Changelog

## [0.6.0] fix prompt

### Added
- **Strategic Maze Evaluator v2.0**: Complete rewrite of the maze evaluator system
  - Advanced stateful pathfinding algorithm with multi-dimensional state tracking
  - Strategic element integration: teleporters (O/Q), switches (s), movable blocks (B)
  - Conditional door logic: X (2+ keys), Y (switch), Z (switch + key)

  - Strategic Innovation: +15 teleporter, +20 switch, +25 conditional door points
  - Route Complexity: Key collection chains and switch activation bonuses
  - Bonus Objectives: +75 points per optional exit (F/G/H)
  - Strategic Danger: Capped at 30 points for quality over quantity
- **Maze Size Support**: Increased maximum maze dimensions from 32×32 to 64×64
  - Updated validation constants in strategic_evaluator.py
  - Enhanced scalability for larger, more complex strategic mazes
- **Prompt Refinement**: Streamlined and clarified maze generation instructions
  - Simplified strategic elements description and logic
  - Enhanced guidance for conditional door requirements
  - Clearer constraint specifications for maze solvability
