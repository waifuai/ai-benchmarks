# Changelog

## [0.3.0] enhanced scoring system

### Added
- **Enhanced Maze Parsing & Validation**: Fixed regex extraction to handle various LLM output formats including metadata like "TIME: 275s"
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Intelligent error messages with context-aware suggestions for parsing failures, size violations, missing elements, and timeouts
- **Performance Optimization**: 5-second timeout protection for complex maze solving with iteration limits to prevent hanging
- **Detailed Scoring Breakdowns**: Enhanced component breakdowns with comprehensive explanations for ambition, complexity, path efficiency, completion, and danger

### Changed
- **Scoring Calculations**: Verified all scoring components match documented behavior with maintained leaderboard integration
- **CLI Output**: Rich output with component analysis, performance ratings, and actionable feedback
- **Character Validation**: Resolved bugs and improved edge case handling for irregular row lengths and malformed maze detection
- **System Safety**: Implemented comprehensive error tracking and debugging information while maintaining existing progress indicators

### Fixed
- **Regex Extraction**: Fixed handling of various LLM output formats and metadata
- **Size Validation**: Enhanced 32x32 constraint validation with clear error messages
- **BFS Algorithms**: Optimized algorithms with iteration limits to prevent hanging
- **Error Handling**: Fixed missing element detection and timeout handling

### Improved
- **User Experience**: Clear error messages with specific improvement suggestions
- **Parsing Reliability**: Handles diverse LLM output formats without failure
- **Scoring Accuracy**: Calculations verified against benchmark specifications
- **System Reliability**: Robust handling of metadata, edge cases, and malformed inputs

### Verified
- **Sample Processing**: Successfully scores complex mazes (e.g., 675.69 points with full breakdown)
- **Error Handling**: Properly rejects violations (e.g., 34x32 maze > 32x32 limit) with helpful suggestions
- **CLI Enhancement**: Rich output with component analysis, performance ratings, and actionable feedback
- **System Compatibility**: Re-scored existing mazes ensuring calculation consistency
- **Real-world Testing**: Parsing tested with real-world LLM output variations
