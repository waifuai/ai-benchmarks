# Changelog

## [0.2.2] multikey

### Added
- **Multi-Key Maze Logic**: Support for alphabet-based keys (`a`-`z`) and doors (`A`-`Z`).
  - New scoring component: **Complexity (Chain Length)** based on sequential key/door pairs solved.
  - New scoring component: **Path Efficiency** (Length / Grid Size).
  - Updated `prompt.md` to instruct LLMs on the new multi-key rules.
- **Rescore Feature**: Added `--rescore` flag to `run_benchmark.py` to re-evaluate all existing outputs in `output/` directory without re-running models.
- `test_multikey.py`: Test suite for validating the new multi-key maze logic and scoring.

### Changed
- **API Integration**: Improved response parsing to robustly handle usage statistics (prompt/completion/total tokens).
- **Maze Evaluator**: 
  - Overhauled scoring formula to prioritize logical chain completion.
  - Adjusted **Danger** score to use diminishing returns (sqrt) for adjacent traps.
  - Fixed `ZeroDivisionError` in complexity ratio calculation.
