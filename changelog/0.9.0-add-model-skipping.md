# Changelog

## [0.9.0] add model skipping

### Added
- **Model Skip System**: New `models_skip.txt` file for tracking failed or problematic models
  - Automatic movement of failed models from `models.txt` to `models_skip.txt`
  - Prevents re-testing of consistently failing models
  - Improved batch execution efficiency by avoiding known problematic models
- **Automatic Model Management**: Enhanced benchmark runner with smart model handling
  - `move_model_to_skip()` function for automated model organization
  - Both parallel and sequential execution modes now automatically skip failed models
  - Clear feedback when models are moved to skip list during execution

### Changed
- **Model List Optimization**: Streamlined `models.txt` from 29 to 10 active models
  - Removed 19 underperforming or consistently failing models
  - Focused on higher-quality models for more reliable benchmarking
  - Moved removed models to new `models_skip.txt` for reference
- **Leaderboard Expansion**: Added 7 new model results to leaderboard
  - New entries include google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp, nvidia/nemotron-nano-9b-v2, and others
  - Updated rankings reflect latest benchmark performance
- **String Formatting**: Fixed escape character issues throughout `run_benchmark.py`
  - Corrected `\\n` to `\n` for proper newline handling
  - Improved regex patterns for better model detection and time extraction
  - Enhanced string formatting consistency across the codebase

### Improved
- **Execution Efficiency**: Faster batch processing by avoiding known failing models
- **Error Handling**: Better feedback when models are automatically moved to skip list
- **Code Quality**: Cleaner string handling and more robust regex patterns
- **Leaderboard Accuracy**: More reliable rankings with focus on consistently performing models
