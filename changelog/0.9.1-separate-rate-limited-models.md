# Changelog

## [0.9.1] separate rate limited models

### Added
- **Rate Limit Error Separation**: New `models_limited.txt` file for tracking rate-limited models separately from failed models
  - Rate-limited models now moved to `models_limited.txt` instead of `models_skip.txt`
  - Clear distinction between temporary rate limits (retryable) vs permanent failures (non-retryable)
  - Enhanced error handling with `[LIMITED]` status for rate-limited models vs `[SKIP]` for other failures

### Improved
- **Model Management**: Better organization of benchmark results with separate tracking for rate-limited vs failed models
- **User Experience**: Clearer feedback when models encounter rate limits during batch execution
- **Retry Logic**: Models in `models_limited.txt` can be easily identified for later retry attempts
